<h1> <i>    What is API? </i></h1>
<section> 
<h3>  Definition: </h3>
<p> API stands for <b style=color:#ee000e;><ins> Application Programming Interface.</b></ins> In basic terms, APIs are a set of functions and procedures that allow for the creation of applications that access data and features of other applications, 
<br/> services, or operating systems.</p>
The API is not the database or even the server, it is the code that governs the access point(s) for the server.

<h1> <i> API Types </h1> </i>
<p> There are four principal types of API commonly used in web-based applications: <b> public, partner, private and composite.</b>
<br/> 
<br/>
<b style="color:#ee000e">Public APIs:</b> A public API is open and available for use by any outside developer or business. An enterprise that cultivates a business strategy that involves sharing its applications and data with other businesses will develop and offer a public API.

Public APIs typically involve moderate authentication and authorization. An enterprise also may seek to monetize the API by imposing a per-call cost to utilize the public API.</p>
<p><b style="color:#ee000e"> Partner APIs </b> 
 A partner API, only available to specifically selected and authorized outside developers or API consumers, is a means to facilitate business-to-business activities. For example, if a business wants to selectively share its customer data with outside CRM firms, a partner API can connect the internal customer data system with those external parties -- no other API use is permitted.
</section>
<section>
Partners have clear rights and licenses to access such APIs. For this reason, partner APIs generally incorporate stronger authentication, authorization and security mechanisms. Enterprises also typically do not monetize such APIs directly; partners are paid for their services rather than through API use.</p>
<p><b style="color:#ee000e"> Internal APIs:</b> An internal (or private) API is intended only for use within the enterprise, to connect systems and data within the business. For example, an internal API may connect an organization's payroll and HR systems.
</section>
<section>
Internal APIs traditionally present weak security and authentication -- or none at all -- because the APIs are intended for internal use, and such security levels are assumed to be in place through other policies. This is changing, however, as greater threat awareness and regulatory compliance demands increasingly influence an organization's API strategy.</p>
<p><b style="color:#ee000e"> Composite APIs:</b> Composite APIs generally combine two or more APIs to craft a sequence of related or interdependent operations. Composite APIs can be beneficial to address complex or tightly-related API behaviors, and can sometimes improve speed and performance over individual APIs.</p>

<h3>1. Weather Snippets </h3>
<br/>
<p> 
One common API usage example we come across on a daily basis is weather data. Rich weather snippets seem to be commonplace, found on all platforms, like Google Search, Apple’s Weather app, or even from your smart home device. For example, if you search “weather + [your city’s name]” on Google, you’ll see a dedicated box at the top of the search results (called a rich snippet) with the current weather conditions and forecast. As an example, here’s the search for “weather Berlin”.

<br/>Google isn’t in the business of weather data (yet!), so they source this information from a third party. They do so by means of an API, which sends them the latest weather details in a way that’s easy for them to reformat. As we’ve previously covered, there are many weather APIs that power this kind of functionality.

<h3>2. Log-in Using XYZ </h3>

Another prominent example of API usage is the “log-in using Facebook/Twitter/Google/Github” functionality you see on so many websites. It’s incredibly convenient, but have you ever wondered how it works?
Instead of actually logging-in to users’ social media accounts (which would pose a serious security concern), applications with this functionality leverage these platforms’ APIs to authenticate the user with each login. For example, here’s the Facebook Login API.
The way it works is pretty simple. Every time the application loads, it uses the API to check whether the user is already logged in by means of whatever social media platform. If not, when the user clicks the “Log-in Using XYZ” button, a pop-up opens where they are asked to confirm they actually want to log-in with that social media profile. When the user confirms, the API provides the application with identification information, so it knows who’s logging in.

<h3>3. Pay with PayPal </h3>
<aside><img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTZAQmBPTMJGYURj48RAuK0D_c_KUIUNks15w&usqp=CAU" align="right" hieght="200px" width="400px"/></aside>

the “Pay with PayPal” functionality is built with APIs to ensure that the end application can only do what it needs to, without being exposed to sensitive data or gaining access to unintended permissions.
In terms of the inner-workings of this handy function, it’s very similar to the log-in process described above. When the user clicks the “Pay with PayPal” button, the application sends an “order” request to the PayPal API, specifying the amount owed and other important details. Then, a pop-up authenticates the user and confirms their purchase. Finally, if everything goes to plan, the API sends confirmation of payment back to the application.
